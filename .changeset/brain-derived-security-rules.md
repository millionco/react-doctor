Add five `security-scan` rules distilled from security-researcher writeups and the deepsec scanner-matcher catalog, closing CWE shapes the bucket didn't cover:

- **`unsafe-json-in-html`** — `JSON.stringify(...)` embedded in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or inline `<script>` markup. `JSON.stringify` does not HTML-escape, so data containing `</script>` or `<` breaks out — the classic SSR data-hydration XSS. Suppressed when an HTML-safe serializer (serialize-javascript, devalue, superjson) or `\u003c` escaping is used.
- **`jwt-insecure-verification`** — the JWT `none` algorithm (`alg: none` / `algorithms: ["none"]`), which disables signature verification and lets any forged token through. (Detecting an unpinned `jwt.verify` precisely needs scope-aware analysis, so that is left to a future AST rule.)
- **`secret-in-fallback`** — a secret-shaped env var with a hardcoded string fallback (`process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY ?? "<hardcoded>"`): a committed secret that also makes the app fail open when the var is unset. Skips public vars (PUBLIC/PUBLISHABLE/ANON) and placeholder defaults.
- **`request-body-mass-assignment`** — spreading or merging request input (`{ ...req.body }`, `Object.assign(target, req.body)`, lodash `merge`/`defaultsDeep`) without a field allowlist: mass assignment (client-set owner/role/price columns) or prototype pollution.
- **`insecure-session-cookie`** — auth/session cookies exposed to JavaScript: `httpOnly: false`, set via `document.cookie`, or a bare `res.cookie("session", value)` / `cookies().set(...)` with no options.

All five register through `defineRule` with a project-level `scan`, carry the `Security` category and `security-scan` tag, and are silenced by `react-doctor rules ignore-tag security-scan` like the rest of the family.
