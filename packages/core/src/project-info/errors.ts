/**
 * Narrow errors raised by the project-discovery helpers
 * (`discoverProject` / `resolveDiagnoseTarget` / `readPackageJson`).
 *
 * These extend `Error` directly — they are NOT the tagged
 * `ReactDoctorError` from `../errors.js` (that one wraps every
 * runtime-pipeline failure as a `Schema.TaggedErrorClass` for
 * `Effect.catchReasons` dispatch). The split is intentional:
 *
 * - Discovery happens BEFORE the Effect runtime takes over — at the
 *   `diagnose()` / CLI entry point — and throws plain JS exceptions
 *   so callers can `try/catch` without an Effect-layer-aware
 *   `instanceof` check.
 * - The Project service (`services/project.ts → translateProjectInfoError`)
 *   translates each of these into the equivalent tagged-error
 *   `reason` before re-raising inside the Effect pipeline, so the
 *   runtime never sees a non-tagged failure.
 *
 * If you're inside the Effect runtime, use the tagged
 * `ReactDoctorError` from `../errors.js` instead.
 */

/**
 * Distinguishes the two situations that both surface as "no project here", so
 * the rendered message matches reality:
 *
 * - `no-project` (default): the path exists but has no React project — no
 *   `package.json` at the root and no discoverable nested React subproject.
 * - `missing-path`: the resolved scan target does not exist on disk at all
 *   (a typo, a stale temp path, a monorepo subdir that isn't present). The
 *   generic "expected a package.json" guidance is misleading here, so point
 *   at the missing path instead.
