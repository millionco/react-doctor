Fixed false positives in `dangerous-html-sink` (the highest-volume new rule) reported by RDE evals on `repos.json` (200 rootDir scans / 19 distinct repos / 51 total new security diagnostics).

- Email HTML components (RawHtml, \*Email templates in cal.com `packages/emails`, dub `packages/email`, etc.) were reported even though the rule intends to exempt them (mail clients strip scripts; browser XSS model does not apply). The `EMAIL_TEMPLATE_PATH_PATTERN` skip only looked at the scan-relative path and missed cases where `rootDir` was already the emails package (relativePath = `src/components/RawHtml.tsx`).
- Trusted rich-text renderers (tldraw `renderHtmlFromRichText(editor, richText)` result assigned to bare `html` then used at a sink in labels) were not recognized, unlike the existing katex / renderToStaticMarkup / hast-util cases in `ESCAPING_SERIALIZER_LIBRARY_PATTERN`. Same shape as the "KaTeX-rendered html identifiers" regression that already passes.

Updated `EMAIL_TEMPLATE_PATH_PATTERN` (now also matches RawHtml and \*Email filenames) and `ESCAPING_SERIALIZER_LIBRARY_PATTERN` (added `renderHtmlFromRichText`). Added two regression tests using the exact hit shapes from the 51-eval corpus.

A second eval pass (replaying the rule against every corpus hit's real source) surfaced four more false-positive classes, now fixed:

- **Empty / literal clears with a trailing comment** — `el.innerHTML = '' // clear` was flagged because the trailing line comment defeated `STRING_LITERAL_VALUE_PATTERN`, after which the value scan bled into the next statement and tainted on an unrelated token there (PostHog `NotebookNodeLatex` reading `content` on the following line). The literal/constant exemptions now tolerate a trailing line comment.
- **`createHTMLDocument()` parse-to-text** — a disconnected document (no browsing context, scripts never run) used to strip tags to text (tldraw `stripHtml`) is now treated as inert.
- **Detached `createElement` scratch nodes** — a node that is parsed, then queried / read back, and never attached to a live tree nor returned as a node (Plane `paste-asset`) is now inert; the existing "parsed HTML reaches the document" guard still fires when the node is appended.
- **In-house serializers + highlighter output via member access** — `render*HTML(...)` serializers (pierre `renderPartialHTML`) and highlighter output stored on an object (`highlightedFiles[0].darkHtml`, shiki) are exempt when a serializer library is present in the file, matching the existing bare-identifier handling.

Added seven regression tests (including a still-fires guard for object-stored HTML with no serializer library and for scratch nodes appended to the live tree) using the exact hit shapes from the corpus.

This hardens the 6 new security-scan rules (`dangerous-html-sink`, `clickjacking-redirect-risk`, `insecure-crypto-risk`, `mcp-tool-capability-risk`, `raw-sql-injection-risk`, `url-prefilled-privileged-action`) that landed in the posture scanner.
