Add a `supabase-table-missing-rls` security-scan rule. It flags a Supabase migration (`supabase/migrations/**`, `supabase/schemas/**`) that runs `create table` for a public-schema table but never enables Row Level Security — the highest-impact and most common Supabase misconfiguration, because RLS is OFF by default for SQL-created tables, so every row is readable and writable with the public anon key. It targets the same misconfiguration Supabase's own `rls_disabled_in_public` database linter flags, and the gap that turns the public anon key into the service key.

The existing `supabase-rls-policy-risk` only caught an explicit `disable row level security`; this complements it by catching the far more common "never enabled it" case. RLS is checked per table — each `create table` must have an `alter table <name> enable row level security` for that same table, after the create (a sibling table enabling RLS, or a policy without enabling it, does not vouch). SQL comments and string literals are ignored, non-public/Supabase-managed schemas (`auth.`, `storage.`, a `private.` schema, …) are skipped, and the rule is scoped to the `supabase/` directory so plain Drizzle/Prisma `.sql` migrations are not flagged. The scan runs per migration file, so enabling RLS in a _different_ migration than the `create table` is not detected — the same-file pattern (what Supabase tooling emits) is the supported case. Like the rest of the family it carries the `security-scan` tag and is silenced by `react-doctor rules ignore-tag security-scan`.
